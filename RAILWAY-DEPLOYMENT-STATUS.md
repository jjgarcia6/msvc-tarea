# ABC Motor - Railway Deployment Guide

## Fixed Issues

### âœ… Dockerfile Corruption Issue RESOLVED
- **Problem**: The Dockerfile was corrupted during edits, causing "no build stage in current context" error
- **Solution**: Created a clean, properly structured multi-stage Dockerfile

### âœ… Health Check Issues RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Services were failing health checks due to insufficient startup time
- **Solution**: Extended health check timeouts and improved startup scripts

## Current Configuration

### Scripts Available:
- `railway-production.sh` - **Production script with full diagnostics** (Default)
- `railway-start.sh` - Simple startup (Eureka + Gateway only)
- `railway-debug.sh` - Debug script with detailed logging
- `entrypoint.sh` - Full 4-service startup
- `start-services.sh` - Original multi-service script

### Health Check Configuration:
- **Timeout**: 120 seconds (allows proper Spring Boot initialization)
- **Interval**: 45 seconds
- **Start Period**: 120 seconds
- **Retries**: 5

### Memory Optimization:
- JVM heap limited to 512MB per service (`-Xmx512m`)
- Optimized for Railway's memory constraints

## Railway Deployment Status

### âœ… Build Phase - WORKING
- Multi-stage Docker build
- All JAR files properly compiled
- Scripts copied and permissions set

### ðŸ”§ Runtime Phase - IN PROGRESS
The current setup should resolve the startup issues:

1. **Eureka Server** starts first (port 8761)
2. **Gateway** starts second (Railway's PORT)
3. **Health check** on Gateway endpoint
4. **Full diagnostics** available in logs

## Expected Deployment Flow

```
1. Railway detects Dockerfile âœ…
2. Build stage compiles all services âœ…
3. Runtime stage copies JARs and scripts âœ…
4. Container starts with railway-production.sh âœ…
5. Eureka initializes (30-60 seconds) ðŸ”§
6. Gateway connects to Eureka ðŸ”§
7. Health check passes on /actuator/health ðŸ”§
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails, check Railway logs for:

### Startup Diagnostics:
```
=== ABC Motor Railway Startup with Diagnostics ===
Current time: [timestamp]
Working directory: /app
Process ID: [pid]
Configuration:
- EUREKA_PORT: 8761
- GATEWAY_PORT: [Railway assigned port]
- PORT (Railway): [Railway assigned port]
```

### JAR Verification:
```
=== Verifying JAR files ===
âœ“ eureka-server.jar exists ([size])
âœ“ gateway.jar exists ([size])
```

### Service Startup:
```
=== Starting Eureka Server ===
Eureka started with PID: [pid]
[1/30] Waiting for Eureka...
âœ“ Eureka is healthy on port 8761
=== Starting Gateway ===
Gateway will be the main process (foreground)
```

## Files Structure
```
/app/
â”œâ”€â”€ eureka-server.jar          # Eureka Server
â”œâ”€â”€ gateway.jar                # API Gateway (main service)
â”œâ”€â”€ products.jar               # Products microservice
â”œâ”€â”€ sales.jar                  # Sales microservice
â”œâ”€â”€ railway-production.sh      # Main startup script
â”œâ”€â”€ railway-start.sh           # Simple startup
â”œâ”€â”€ railway-debug.sh           # Debug startup
â”œâ”€â”€ entrypoint.sh             # Full services startup
â”œâ”€â”€ start-services.sh         # Original startup
â”œâ”€â”€ health-check.sh           # Health verification
â””â”€â”€ logs/                     # Log directory
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** with the corrected Dockerfile
2. **Monitor logs** for the diagnostic output
3. **Verify health check** passes within 2 minutes
4. **Test endpoints** once deployment succeeds

The configuration is now optimized for Railway's environment and should deploy successfully.
